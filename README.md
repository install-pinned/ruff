Securely install the latest [ruff](https://pypi.org/project/ruff/) release from PyPI.

This action installs a pinned version of **ruff** and all its dependencies,         making sure that file hashes match. Pinning your dependencies:

 1. Stops software supply chain attacks.
 2. Makes sure your CI does not break unexpectedly.

## Usage

In your GitHub Actions workflow, use this action like so:

```yaml
      - name: Install ruff from PyPI
        uses: install-pinned/ruff@300f9ae87a7c1074e07c9841c57c7aedcf49b10d  # 0.0.212
```

You can [set up Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/keeping-your-actions-up-to-date-with-dependabot#example-dependabotyml-file-for-github-actions)
so that your pins are updated regularly.

## Alternatives

This action is a relatively simple wrapper around the fantastic [pip-tools](https://pip-tools.rtfd.io)         and is most useful if there is no existing `requirements.txt`/`poetry.lock`/... infrastructure in place.         If you already pin all your dependencies in a single place, you don't need it!
